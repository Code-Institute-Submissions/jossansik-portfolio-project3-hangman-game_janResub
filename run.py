RULES = '''
===============================================================================
Let's play a game of animal word-hangman!

Rules: 
* The player will guess what animal is hidden in the secret word, which is 
represented by a row of dashes for each letter of the word. 
* If the player suggest a letter which occurs in the word, it is written out in all 
its correct positions. 
* If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, one element of a 
hanged stick figure is drawn out as a tally mark. 
* If the player makes 8 incorrect guesses, the hanged man diagram is completes 
and the guesser loses.
* If the word is correctly guessed, the game is over and the player wins. 

Press enter to start the game!
