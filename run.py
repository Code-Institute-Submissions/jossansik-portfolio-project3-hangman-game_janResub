RULES = '''
===============================================================================
Let's play a game of animal word-hangman!

Rules:
* Guess the secret word, represented by dashes for each letter of the word.
* If the guessed letter occurs in the word, it is written out in all its
correct positions.
* If the guessed letter does not occur in the word, one element of a
hanged stick figure is drawn out as a tally mark.
* After 8 incorrect guesses, the hanged man is completed and the guesser loses.
* If the word is correctly guessed, the game is over and the player wins.
